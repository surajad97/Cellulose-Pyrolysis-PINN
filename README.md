Data-driven discovery of kinetics including catalytic reactions and secondary reactions for pyrolysis of Cellulose

The demand for renewable energy is increasing and biomass, as one of the most important renewable energy, is attracting significant attention in recent years. To understand and model pyrolysis of biomass, such as cellulose, the detailed kinetics are in high demand. Conventional kinetic analysis requires a lot of prior knowledge and chemical insights. However, due to the complex process involved in the pyrolysis, the conventional kinetic analysis methods face noticeable challenge, especially for catalytic reactions or secondary reactions. Benefiting from the huge amount of experimental data and rapidly developed scientific machine learning techniques, a data-driven method, based on chemical reaction neural network, is employed in the present study to discover the kinetics for pyrolysis of cellulose. Experiments have been conducted with different initial mass (5-20 mg), heating rates (2.5-10 K/min), with/without catalyst, with/without lid. Kinetics are finally obtained through the data-driven method for cellulose pyrolysis, with special focus on catalytic reactions and secondary reactions. The obtained kinetics are physically interpreted and finally validated against the conventional data-fitting methods, demonstrating its high fidelity for future modeling purpose.
